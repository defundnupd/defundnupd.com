On June 17, #BlackAtNU released [demands](https://sites.google.com/view/blackatnu/) for racial equity at Northeastern University, including the termination of NUPD's interagency agreements with the Boston Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the disarmament of NUPD, and the creation of a Restorative Justice Center at NU. On June 30, Senior Vice President Ralph Martin announced the creation of the NUPD Advisory Board and its membership. There was no transparency regarding how members were chosen, and the Board can only make recommendations to university leadership - it is not empowered to make change itself.

In response, Northeastern community members sent [this email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B6nZ6IYJAx33Ii-DczfHvU2O6ujvvEyKiKJjPkr_Nm0/edit?usp=sharing) over 120 times to Chancellor Ken Henderson, VP Madeleine Estabrook, Dean Robert Jose, Dean James Hackney, and other administrators. The emails included [this fact sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gURGaR3ESA5gV_kaSZb7aw80rrFQMcYQ/view) on why we must defund and demilitarize NUPD. We also asked students to tweet at President Aoun and sign onto the #BlackAtNU platform.

Below are some responses to our emails from admin.

**VP Madeleine Estabrook:** "Thank you for sharing your concerns about NUPD. I appreciate your taking the time to weigh in on these important issues.

In his June 15th message to the Northeastern community, President Aoun outlined a series of action steps the university will take to improve the experiences of Black Americans in our community, including the creation of an Advisory Board for NUPD. The Advisory Board’s purpose is to promote dialogue and mutual understanding, build trust, and strengthen NUPD’s relationship with the campus community and its neighbors. The inaugural meeting of the board will take place this week, and there will be many additional opportunities—such as town hall forums—for others to contribute in the future.

It’s important to note that NUPD is embracing this opportunity to collaborate and strengthen its relationship with our community, in Boston and across our network of campuses. In a time where other departments across the country are resistant to this kind of examination, we are fortunate that NUPD’s current leadership is both enlightened and progressive.

Thank you again for your input. I look forward to working with you to make the changes necessary to build a more equitable and inclusive Northeastern in the weeks and months ahead."

**Dean James Hackney:** "I received your letter and I understand, firsthand, the concerns you and other members of our community are raising related to policing and issues regarding racial disparities. I also know our police chief, Mike Davis, and have confidence in his sensitivity toward these issues. He is currently working on plans to be responsive to issues raised due to recent events.

The creation of a Community Advisory Board is something that any interested member of the community should engage in. I understand that there will be town halls and other discussions for the Advisory Board to acquire feedback. I have been informed that facts about the training and efficacy of how the NU department operates will be provided, and that there will be sessions for NUPD to hear from the community. Our general counsel let me know that the chief has already participated in a number of feedback sessions with black students.

Of course, this is only the beginning of an engagement process. I know there are strong feelings about policing, many of which are valid, but that does not mean that they all apply to the Northeastern department. I would urge you to engage with the process and find ways to learn about and help shape the department as it evolves.

I also reviewed the 'Areas for Sustained Progress' in the #BlackAtNU document and look forward to working with the community on these concerns as well in my capacity as dean and co-chair of the Presidential Council on Diversity and Inclusion."
