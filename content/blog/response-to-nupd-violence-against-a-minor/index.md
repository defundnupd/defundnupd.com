Members of the Northeastern and Boston communities,

"I can't believe what you say because I see what you do." - James Baldwin

On Thurs, Nov. 12, a video [circulated](https://twitter.com/Prodigalson2025/status/1326999893538385922) on Twitter in which Northeastern University Police Department officers threw a thirteen-year-old boy to the ground and handcuffed him on Columbus Avenue. As students, we unequivocally condemn the handling of this incident. The officers needlessly escalated the situation and caused the minor to be emotionally distressed. Regardless of the circumstances, this response was not warranted. We have several questions for university administration and NUPD, but most importantly, what is Northeastern doing to address this harm caused with the minor and his family? 

Northeastern administration has said that they have seen demands from [\#BlackatNU](https://sites.google.com/view/blackatnu/) and [\#BlackVoicesMatter](https://sites.google.com/view/blackvoicesmatter/home) and the [petition](https://bit.ly/NUPDdatapetition) for data transparency from #DefundNUPD. However, they have done little to nothing since June to respond to these demands or work with students. Further, the University has offered band-aid solutions such as the NUPD Advisory Board, a feedback system, and added oversight, but incidents of violence like this one can and will continue to occur unless NUPD's presence and power are severely decreased. Northeastern administration must sincerely incorporate student demands, defund NUPD, and invest in student and community wellbeing. Members of the surrounding communities must be made to feel safe, welcomed, and a part of the broader Northeastern community. Anything less is to deny humanity.

Signed,
