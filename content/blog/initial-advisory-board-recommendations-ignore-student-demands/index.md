To the Northeastern University community,

On October 5th, 2020 Jack McDevitt provided an email update to students about the Northeastern University Police Department Advisory Board (hereafter, the Board). After two town halls and four listening sessions, the Board announced two recommendations to be given to NU leadership – a feedback system and oversight for Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD) misconduct. Both of these recommendations fail to address any of the demands of #BlackAtNU, #BlackVoicesMatter, and #DefundNUPD. But more pressingly, the Board by design is not equipped with the power to address student demands.

The Board, rather than being given the power to implement substantive changes, serves to quell student concerns by diverting activism and demands into formal bureaucratic processes that legitimize NUPD. The Board’s function is apparent from its form: Attorney Ralph Martin, who oversees the NUPD serves on the Board, NUPD officers are unofficial members of the Board and have even been given the platform to claim they have already been “defunded” because they engage in community policing. Northeastern leadership and the Board fail to respond to repeated challenges to the need for an armed private police force on our campus in the first place. The current recommendations ultimately do no more than further entrench the institution of policing on our campus and in the city of Boston while paying lip service to longstanding student demands.

Even before the listening sessions, student organizers made their demands clear on a myriad of formats, including websites, email, petitions, social media and other platforms. Yet their calls to action before, during, and after the listening sessions are absent from the Board’s current recommendations. We echo the demands of Black student-led organizations here with salient updates.

1. **Termination of the interagency law enforcement agreements with the Boston Police Department (BPD) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).**

   a. Neither recommendation responds to data publishing demands made by students. In July 2020, a petition with over 600 signatures requesting transparency from NUPD by the first day of undergraduate classes was met with no official response. Today, the petition has over 800 signatures.

   b. Despite assurances that NUPD is sensitive to student concerns, Chief of Police Michael Davis has not been willing to provide additional information regarding NUPD’s activities. It strains credulity to claim that Northeastern University values its BIPOC students while refusing to supply the most basic data. It is past time that NUPD stopped operating behind an opaque veil of secrecy.
2. **Disarmament of the NUPD by the end of 2020.** Neither recommendation aims to prevent violence caused by the presence of armed police forces; rather, the recommendations allow for response only after the police commit harm. The first step in creating a safer community is removal of all lethal weapons from our campus.

   a. In March 2020, NU responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by laying off many of its campus staff including dining hall workers, janitors, parking attendants, and security guards. Yet, to our knowledge, even without students, staff, or faculty on campus, the NUPD had no layoffs, budget cuts, or hiring freezes.

   b. NUPD enforces the student code of conduct and intimidates graduate students who are engaged in union organizing efforts while enjoying the benefits and protection of membership in a police union. We need not elaborate here on the well-documented ways in which police unions impede reform efforts by hindering the very kinds of systems proposed by the recommendations. *See, e.g.,* Steven Greenhouse, *How Police Unions Enable and Conceal Abuses of Power* (June 18, 2020), <https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-police-union-power-helped-increase-abuses>; Stephen Rushin, *Police Union Contracts,* 66 Duke L.J. 1191 (2017).

   c. Members of NUPD have donated to the Trump campaign since June 2020 and have been seen in online photos with “Blue Lives Matter” paraphernalia. To equate a choice in profession with Black identity is egregious. To financially support a presidential candidate who refuses to condemn white supremacist organizations is inexcusable. Public relations stunts such as handing out hot chocolate and tea and giving tours of the department building does nothing to prevent them from racially profiling and traumatizing members of our community.
3. **Immediate removal of NUPD from the operation of safety escort services, self-defense and CPR, property registration, community programs, and the lost and found.** None of those programs require a lethal weapon. Instead, having the police manage these programs only serves to increase their budget and presence on campus and in surrounding communities.
4. **Creation of a Restorative Justice Center and sustainable alternatives to private policing.**

   a. The Office of Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution (OSCCR), a punitive arm of NUPD, should be transformed into a Restorative Justice Center capable of providing healing, resolution, and accountability. As the former director of OSCCR, Briana Sevigny, has recently left the position, the time is ripe to restructure and reimagine what accountability looks like in our community. NUPD should not be involved in mental health checks, non-emergency medical transports, or incidents involving drug and substance abuse. Instead, the new Restorative Justice Center, University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS), and the Office of Prevention and Education should receive additional funds to take over management of these incidents from NUPD.

   b. NUPD should not be a required tenant to implementing programming put on at the university. Offices on campus should not have to spend their own budget on paying the university’s own private police force to be present at events.
5. **Action to assess failure to retain students, staff, and faculty of color.** The retention rates for staff and faculty of color at NU are abysmal. How many Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC) staff and faculty have left the university in the past year? What percentage of Black students are at NU today?

   a. NU has a white supremacy problem. NU leadership is already aware of the poor retention rates of BIPOC student, faculty, and staff. Though efforts are made to keep students uninformed about faculty and staff disputes, we have learned that Northeastern University Housing & Residential Life has called out the issues of white supremacy and insincere efforts at diversity and inclusion among NU leadership in their own department.

   b. NU must invest financial and social resources in the departments developing culturally competent students. Currently, the Cultural Life Centers have over five positions and counting open and unfilled. Even in the Cultural Life centers, where employees are hired to support BIPOC and LGBT students, NU is unable to retain staff.

We demand a response from President Aoun on **each** point of this letter. His continued decision to invest in a racist system armed with lethal weapons harms each and every one of us on this campus. From the demands of Black Students in 1968 to today, NU has continually and systemically failed to address its participation in upholding and reinforcing white supremacy.

Addressing President Aoun and the rest of the leadership team directly: You have the power to be a leading force of change on a global scale. NU has the ability to respond swiftly and decisively no matter the cost, as has been demonstrated by NU’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. Racism is also an urgent crisis requiring an equally swift response. If ending contracts with NUPD would cost a significant amount of money, it is time you ask if NU should continue to invest in white supremacist practices. Take bold action and be courageous by investing in your students and community.

Signed,
