We then broke into groups to complete action items, including signing a petition to make NUPD's policing data and policies publicly available. This "Hour to Action" model is based on similar actions conducted by groups organizing to defund the Boston Police Department. 

[The petition](https://campaigns.organizefor.org/petitions/tell-pres-aoun-and-chief-davis-to-publish-nupd-policing-data-and-policies?share=bf841c01-be5d-44ec-b893-fea92cf0d485&source=rawlink&utm_source=rawlink&share) was delivered to NU admin and members of the NUPD Advisory Board on July 22 with over 600 signatures.

In Advisory Board listening sessions, Jack McDevitt has stated that admin are aware of the petition, but there has been no official response or release of data for nearly three months.
