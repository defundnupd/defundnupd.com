Hi everyone,

We will be reading We Do This 'Til We Free Us by Mariame Kaba on Thursdays from 6 to 7 pm starting on June 3rd, 2021.

If you are interested in abolition, we encourage you to join us during this time as we educate ourselves and get to know each other. 

We will be providing reading material so all you need to do is sign up and show up for our first meeting.
