On Sept. 2, we hosted another "Hour to Action" based on the Defund BosCops model. Our educational discussion covered what interagency agreements between municipal and campus police departments look like, why we can't access NUPD's due to Northeastern being a private institution, and why we should be concerned about collaboration between NUPD and BPD. We then broke out into groups to tweet at NU admin and send them [this email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_W5rxus8o1cUqA416tYMZdoldTYS3tqjjHu-3S64osw/edit?usp=sharing).

During the action hour, we also discussed our current efforts to access interagency agreements between NUPD and BPD by making a public records request, since BPD is a public entity. So far, all the request has yielded is [this MOU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15EvrIMZhSvUqRZFpwLVXNjwMG9RfGV73/view?usp=sharing) that references Boston University PD, but makes no reference to NUPD.
