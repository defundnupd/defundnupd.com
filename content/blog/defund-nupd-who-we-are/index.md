Defund NUPD is a coalition of undergraduate and graduate students at Northeastern University demanding the total abolition of the Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD). We are student abolitionists who recognize abolishing NUPD as one small step in the total abolition of the prison industrial complex, a complex built on the maintenance of torture, punishment, surveillance, and imprisonment. We follow in the footsteps of Black radical abolitionists before us who imagine safety outside of white supremacist conceptions and institutions and instead work to create the conditions that sustain life and healing. 

We recognize that NUPD does not make us safer and instead serves as an institution of terror that targets Black, Indigenous, People of Color, queer, trans, unhoused, undocumented, and disabled community members. While students are directly harmed by NUPD’s existence, we also recognize the immense violence Northeastern has brought upon the wider Boston and Roxbury communities through gentrification and its enforcement by NUPD’s presence. NUPD serves and protects only whiteness and property. We are here to fight back against this and build an abolitionist space on campus to connect students who share this collective vision.
